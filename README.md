## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze Airbnb data for properties in Seattle. We provide insights into various aspects of the Airbnb market, by responding to the following questions:

- What is the distribution of property types listed on Airbnb in Seattle? (e.g., apartments, houses, condos) And their average prices?
- Is there a correlation between the number of reviews and the rental price?
