Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis
Library Used
This project was implemented using Python programming language and leveraged popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization. The Jupyter Notebook served as the primary environment for running queries and generating insights from the Seattle Airbnb  dataset.

File Description
Project_1_Airbnb_Seattle.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code, queries, and visualizations used for the analysis of the Seattle Airbnb dataset.

Project Motivation
The main motivation behind this project was to explore and extract meaningful insights from the Seattle Airbnb dataset. By addressing key questions related to programming languages, developer demographics, and the global distribution of professional developers, the analysis aims to contribute valuable knowledge to the developer community and the broader field of software development.

Questions addressed by Project:
What were the most widely used programming languages among developers in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017?

Are there any correlations between factors such as age, education, or years of experience with the technologies developers choose to use?

Which countries have the most professional developers?
